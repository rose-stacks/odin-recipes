        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices thick-cut hickory smoked bacon, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced baby portobello mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 pound carrots, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Â½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p> Toss together beef pieces, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; set aside.</p></li> 
        <li><p>Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until fat is rendered and bacon is beginning to brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Add seasoned beef to bacon and cook, stirring often, until well browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add mushrooms and tomato paste to mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Stir in broth, wine, and carrots and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 40 to 45 minutes or until beef is fork-tender.</p></li>
        <li><p>Uncover and remove 1/2 cup broth to a 1-cup glass measuring cup. Whisk in flour until completely combined and smooth. Stir flour mixture back into beef mixture and stir constantly until thickened slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.</p></li>
